## Running the code
Prior to running each stage of the analysis, you need to create a folder with the same name as the R script (minus the extension). E.g. 1_PrepareDiversityData for the first stage

## Required packages
The following packages need to be installed prior to running this analysis pipeline (available on CRAN unless specified):
